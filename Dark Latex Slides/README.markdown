## Dark Latex Slides

Here I have two options, (1.) a more dynamic and complex dark slides format from [Kartik Prabhu](https://github.com/kartikprabhu/Kalgan-Mule-template).

For these download the `beamercolorthememule.sty` and `beamerthemeKalgan.sty` in the same location as the Dynamic LaTeX slides tex file. These are useful for having a rolling outline, some color customization, and an advanced view at customizing your own slide style. I've cut down a lot of the detail from his original files to make it a more simple and workable example to start off with. 

Option 2 is to use a simple dark theme involving just the .tex file. Both are created using LaTeX's `beamer` and appeal to those who like using dark slides. 


## For OSU Light Slides:

Check out a cool Ohio State design from [Adam Lauretig](https://github.com/adamlauretig/OSU_brand_slides).
