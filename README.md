# LaTeX-Templates
Various LaTeX Templates and Tutorials. Here you will find the .tex files to run in LaTeX (I prefer TeXMaker too) and what the .pdf ought look like once compiled. Each .tex file will have detailed instructions in the preamble of each format for begginers to LaTeX to be able to understand some of the intuition behind LaTeX (and to more easily customize each format).

# Memo
The LaTeX Memo format is the bare-bones format for writing quick papers or letters. It is a simple .pdf output that can be used for homework assignemnts, medium length papers, or rough-draft articles. It includes some footnote formatting, section formatting, and font formatting.
